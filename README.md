**Pre-requisites:**

Before getting started, you'll need to ensure you have the following:

- Node >=10.9 (is confirmed to working version)
- run npm install


**Notes:**

Scenario: Talent View And Search is failing as after searching for the new talent with the full name another talent appears on the table has the same firstName, which is wrong

after adding the talent, when I search for it on Onboarding tab I see the status is onboarding started not invitation sent
